# cuDF vs Pandas Performance Comparison

This repository provides an in-depth analysis and performance comparison between **cuDF** and **Pandas** for data processing tasks. The goal is to highlight the advantages of GPU-accelerated data frames using cuDF compared to the traditional CPU-based Pandas library, particularly for handling large datasets.

## üìñ Overview

This project demonstrates how **cuDF**, a Python GPU DataFrame library from the **RAPIDS** suite, outperforms **Pandas** when working with large datasets. By leveraging GPU acceleration, cuDF enables parallel computation, significantly reducing execution times for data manipulation tasks such as filtering, grouping, and joining.

### Key Features

- Performance benchmarks comparing cuDF and Pandas on various data operations.
- GPU-accelerated data processing using cuDF.
- Demonstration of the RAPIDS ecosystem integration with cuDF.
- Practical use cases with large datasets.
  
## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the analysis, you need the following tools installed:

- **Python 3.7+**
- **CUDA Toolkit** (if you have an NVIDIA GPU)
- **cuDF** (RAPIDS library)
- **Pandas** (for comparison)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/atullchaurasia/cudf-pandas.git
    cd cudf-pandas
    ```

2. **Set up a Python virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install cudf pandas
    ```

4. **Install CUDA toolkit** (if necessary):
    Refer to the [official RAPIDS documentation](https://rapids.ai/start.html) for CUDA toolkit installation instructions.

### Running the Project

The project includes a Jupyter notebook that contains code comparing the performance of cuDF and Pandas.

1. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2. Open the `cudf_pandas.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to see the benchmark results.

## üìù Project Structure

- `cudf_pandas.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that contains the performance comparison between cuDF and Pandas, showcasing various operations such as joins, group-bys, and filtering.
  
- `data/`: Directory containing any sample datasets used for testing and benchmarking.

## üìä Performance Insights

This section will summarize the performance gains observed from the benchmarks between cuDF and Pandas:

1. **Blazing Speed**: cuDF significantly reduces execution time by leveraging GPU power, handling operations like joins and filtering in a fraction of the time.
2. **Scalability**: cuDF can handle much larger datasets without memory limitations, making it ideal for big data processing.
3. **Parallel Processing**: cuDF utilizes GPU cores for parallel execution, speeding up tasks that Pandas processes sequentially.
4. **Familiar Syntax**: cuDF retains a Pandas-like API, allowing easy transition for users familiar with Pandas.

## ‚öôÔ∏è RAPIDS Ecosystem Integration

cuDF is a core part of the **RAPIDS** ecosystem, enabling seamless integration with other libraries for machine learning, data visualization, and graph analytics. This interoperability allows you to perform end-to-end data science workflows entirely on the GPU.
